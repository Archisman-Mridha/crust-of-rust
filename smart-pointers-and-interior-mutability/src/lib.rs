// NOTE - '&*' is used to cast a raw pointer to a reference pointer (which is safe and bound by the
// ownership rules of Rust).

/*
  Rust memory safety is based on this rule:
  Given an object T, it is only possible to have one of the following:
  |
  |- 1. Having several immutable references (&T) to the object (also known as ALIASING).
  |
  |- 2. Having one mutable reference (&mut T) to the object (also known as MUTABILITY).
  |
  INTERIOR MUTABILITY - in Rust refers to the ability to mutate data even when there are immutable
  references to that data. It is a design pattern that allows you to mutate data through shared
  references (i.e., &T) to achieve mutable fields inside immutable data structures.
  Rust's borrowing rules normally disallow this action, but interior mutability provides a way to
  bend these rules safely. Rust provides several types that enable interior mutability, including
  Cell<T>, RefCell<T>, and OnceCell<T> . These types come with different trade-offs.

    Cell<T> implements interior mutability by moving values in and out of the cell. That is, an
    '&mut T' to the inner value can never be obtained, and the value itself cannot be directly
    obtained without replacing it with something else.
    Both of these rules ensure that there is never more than one reference pointing to the inner
    value.

      to its contents. It is up to you as the abstraction designer to use that raw pointer correctly.

      rules enforced by the Rust compiler.
